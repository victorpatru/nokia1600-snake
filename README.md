### 🛠️ How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS (flexbox), JavaScript (vanilla)


### 💻 Lessons Learned:

* Generated 40 by 40 pixel board using vanilla Javascript
* Used keyboard keycodes to change the direction of the snake on the board
* Randomly generated an item (snake food) on the board that resets once it is eaten
* Used setInterval to create a snake that moves across the board
* Increased the size of the snake based on whether the food counter has increased
